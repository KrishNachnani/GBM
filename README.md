# GBM Survival Analysis

This repository contains Python code for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) survival analysis, developed using Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) and DeepSurv models, along with feature selection techniques.

## Features
- Predict GBM recurrence using survival analysis techniques.
- Feature selection methods: SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Sequential Feature Selection (SFS).
- DeepSurv implementation with hyperparameter optimization.
